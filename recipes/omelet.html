    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>
        A few times a year there’s a new show (or season of a show) that the internet 
        obsesses over, and this time it’s The Bear–Season 2, Episode 9 (and with good reason). 
        In case you haven't had a chance to binge all 10 episodes yet, I won’t disclose too
        much detail. However, what I will tell you is that you have a spectacular cooking 
        scene to look forward to – especially if you’re a foodie.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is a little deep dive into the scene: In the midst of the usual restaurant 
        chaos, Sydney notices that Sugar is struggling to work. She asks if she can make
        her something to eat, and Sugar answers “...an omelet?”. The following scene
        shows Sydney preparing the dish, then serving Sugar a beautiful omelet 
        garnished with fresh chives and crushed potato chips. Although it looks
        like a classic French omelet at first, the addition of potato chips
        seems inspired by the Spanish Tortilla, which is an open-faced omelet
        loaded with thinly-sliced and fried potatoes. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The best thing about this particular cooking scene of The Bear is that we 
        get to see every step of the process, whereas most of the time we only see a 
        few in-between shots and the final dish. Which means only one thing: it’s easy
        to recreate. First, Sydney cracks the eggs into a strainer and whisks them 
        through, then cooks the eggs in a generous amount of melted butter. She then pipes 
        a line of Boursin cheese down the middle, and folds the omelet up into a long
        cylinder before adding the finishing touches.  
    </p>

    <p>
        As someone who loves an omelet (and as a big fan of The Bear), I was eager to give
        this recipe a try. I can’t say I make French omelets often, but when I do,
        consider them an excuse to go all out with butter and, in this case, cheese. 
        Although I wish I could say this was an easy process for me, I did have a difficult
        time folding the omelet as I only had a cast iron skillet (I recommend using a 
        regular nonstick pan). With that being said, the taste of the omelet itself was 
        delicious, and the addition of crushed potato chips was a genius hack that I will
        continue to use with my omelets going forward.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            3 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            1 to 2 tablespoons salted butter, plus more for serving
        </li>
        <li>
            Boursin cheese
        </li>
        <li>
            Fresh chives, thinly sliced
        </li>
        <li>
            Potato chips, gently crushed
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place a fine-mesh sieve over a small bowl. Crack eggs into the sieve, 
            then whisk with a fork until all the egg has strained through.
         </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the Boursin cheese to a pastry bag or a zip-top bag and
             cut a ½-inch hole off the tip end or corner of the zip-top bag. 
             This is to easily pipe a line of Boursin down the center of the omelet. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until melted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the whisked eggs and very lightly scramble using a wooden 
            or plastic spatula. This will make for a light and fluffy omelet. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook, undisturbed, until the top of the omelet looks almost entirely set. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Run the spatula along the sides of the omelet and 
            jiggle the pan back and forth to prevent it from sticking to the pan. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the heat.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Pipe a generous line of Boursin down the middle of the omelet from 
            one end to the other. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Holding the handle of the pan, carefully tilt the pan so that the 
            top of the omelet starts to curl away from the pan. Using a fork 
            or the spatula, gently begin to roll the omelet into a tight cylinder.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently transfer the omelet seem-side down onto a plate, letting 
            it gently roll off the pan. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread some additional butter over the warm omelet, then garnish the 
            omelet with freshly sliced chives and crushed potato chips. 
        </li>
    </ol>
