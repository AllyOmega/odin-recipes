    <p>
        This Seared Tuna happened a lot in our catering days, 
        so much so, I couldn’t bring myself to make it again for a long long time. 
        But a good three years have passed now, and the other day I got a hankering 
        for it, so I thought I’d share! It’s one of those recipes that may seem fancy, 
        but honestly, it couldn’t be any simpler and the best part, it is, it is <em>ridiculously fast!</em>

    </p>

        Here we are pairing it with a cool and crunchy Asian Cucumber Salad and Seasoned 
        Japanese Rice with Furikake, a light and refreshing summer meal.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            10–16 ounces ahi tuna, thawed (sushi-grade)
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon soy sauce or GF liquid aminos
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons high heat oil for searing- peanut oil, wok oil, avocado
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sesame Crust:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            3 tablespoons sesame seeds (black, or both black and white)
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon granulated garlic powder (or onion powder)
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon kosher salt
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon fresh cracked pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning (or dried thyme)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix the Sesame Crust ingredients together in a small bowl.
         </li>
        <li>
            Pat dry the ahi tuna with paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place ahi tuna on a plate, coat all sides with soy sauce. 
            This will help the sesame spice adhere to the tuna.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generously sprinkle all sides of the ahi tuna with the sesame mix, pressing it down into the flesh.
             Coat the sides. 
            <em><u>Read through the rest of the directions before starting because the next
            part goes very quickly.</u></em>
        </li>
        <li>
            The goal here is to get a nice golden sear on all sides without cooking the ahi tuna
             all the way through. HOT PAN is key. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Run the spatula along the sides of the omelet and 
            jiggle the pan back and forth to prevent it from sticking to the pan. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, until very very hot. 
            Turn your hood fan on. Place tongs, metal spatula and splatter guard 
            (or lid) near the stove.  When the pan is hot a flick of water should sizzle loudly.
            Once the skillet is hot, turn the fan on high. Add the oil and coat the pan and let it
            get hot. Carefully lay the tuna in the pan, pressing it down into the skillet with
            a metal spatula. Sear 45-60 seconds- checking the underneath by lifting one 
            corner to see if it is golden. When deeply golden, carefully flip. If not 
            golden, turn the heat up. Sear the other side, 60-90 seconds until 
            golden. Sear the long edges using tongs to hold it upright.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pipe a generous line of Boursin down the middle of the omelet from 
            one end to the other. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Holding the handle of the pan, carefully tilt the pan so that the 
            top of the omelet starts to curl away from the pan. Using a fork 
            or the spatula, gently begin to roll the omelet into a tight cylinder.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place on a cutting board, blot if you like, 
            then using a very sharp knife, thinly slice, and serve. 
        </li>
        <li>
            At this point, you could also refrigerate up to 3 days, and serve this later, 
            chilled. Either way is good.
        </li>
    </ol>
